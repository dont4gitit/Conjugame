This project is based on the free software "conjugue" developed  by Ricardo Ueda Karpischek to conjugate 
Brazilian Portuguese verbs which is available in Ubuntu as a package called "brazilian-conjugate". Some 
ideas may also be derived from Jakson Aquino's GTK GUI for conjugue, GConjugue.

There will be two branches, one based on Pyside, the other on Pygame. In future, they may be merged, 
or one may be abandoned as unfeasible.
